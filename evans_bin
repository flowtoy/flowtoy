"""Thin wrapper to run the evans CLI during development.

Usage: ./evans [COMMAND] [ARGS]

This script runs the `evans` package CLI (the Python package module is still
named `flow` while project metadata uses the `evans` name). When the project
is installed as a package with entry points, this wrapper is not necessary.
